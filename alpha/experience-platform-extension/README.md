This extension allows you to implement the Adobe Experience Cloud capabilities in a more robust way, serving multiple Adobe solutions though one single network call and forward this information to Adobe Data Platform at the same time.

To set up the Experience Platform mobile extension, follow these steps:

- [Adobe Data platform setup](./data-platform-setup.md)
- [Set up the Mobile SDK](./set-up-the-sdk.md)
