### Effortless Implementation

You can get started quickly with only a few lines of code. Project Griffon works with the [Adobe Experience Platform Mobile SDK](../../) to help you inspect and validate app events, logs, device information, and so on.

### Seamless Connection

With Project Griffon, you do not need network proxies, [MiTM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack) and other network gymnastics. Connecting your app to the interface is as easy as scanning a QR code.

### Instant Validation

After connecting, you can easily inspect live-streamed app events and activity and filter and search to eliminate noise. Events contain details about validating, debugging, and troubleshooting  your mobile app implementation.
