# Places Service and Project Griffon

The Places Service views allow you to inspect location entry and exit events on the Project Griffon web UI as well as an innovative on-device view. These handy views provide a convenient interface to view location specific data points for inspection on the web/client for in-context debugging depending on your business workflows.

We know that using location context with your app experiences can make them more engaging. However, debugging and validating location triggers is a pain. Having views to show you what data you are collecting on device we think should go a long way to solve that pain.

## Using Project Griffon for Places Service

To get started, complete the following steps:

1. Ensure you have implemented the latest versions of [Project Griffon](../set-up-project-griffon.md) and [Places Service](location-service-and-project-griffon.md) extensions.
2. Go to https://experience.adobe.com/griffon \(not griffon.adobe.com\).
3. Connect your app to a Project Griffon session.
4. Select the new Places Service view \(per the screenshot below\) to view your events.
