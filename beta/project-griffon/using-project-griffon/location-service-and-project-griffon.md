# Location Service & Project Griffon

The Location Services views allow you to inspect location entry and exit events on the Project Griffon web UI as well as an innovative on-device view. These handy views provide a convenient interface to view location specific data points for inspection on the web/client for in-context debugging depending on your business workflows.

We know that using location context with your app experiences can make them more engaging. However, debugging and validating location triggers is a pain. Having views to show you what data you are collecting on device we think should go a long way to solve that pain.
