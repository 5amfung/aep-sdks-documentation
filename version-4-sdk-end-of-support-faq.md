## Frequently Asked Questions

### What are the reasons to end-of-support Version 4 SDKs?

Version 4 SDKs were first released in September 2013 to support mobile app implementations for Adobe Analytics \(including Mobile Services\), Adobe Audience Manager, Adobe Target, and Adobe Campaign. These performant, well-tested SDKs provided rich functionality and are used in well over 18,000 apps across app stores.

Spurred by customer feedback for more control, performance, and functionality over the years; and to support future product enhancements, we released the re-architected [Adobe Experience Platform Mobile SDKs](./). The new Experience Platform Mobile SDKs replace Version 4 SDKs and provide support for new features such as flexible configuration through Experience Platform Launch, modular Adobe and partner extensions. Solutions such as [Target Visual Experience Composer](using-mobile-extensions/adobe-target-vec.md), [Adobe Experience Platform Location Service](beta/adobe-places.md), and [Project Griffon](beta/project-griffon/) are exclusively available on Experience Platform Mobile SDKs.
