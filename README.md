## About the Adobe Experience Platform Mobile SDK

The Adobe Experience Platform Mobile SDK is required to power Adobe's Experience Cloud solutions and services in your mobile apps. The SDK is composed of the Mobile Core and a series of Adobe Experience Cloud solutions or third-party vendor extensions that depend on the Mobile Core. Each extension registers with the Mobile Core to provide features specific to the solution or service it represents.

To implement the SDK, create a mobile property in Adobe Experience Platform Launch, set up the configuration required by the Mobile Core and by other extensions you may add, and publish the configuration into an environment. To initialize the SDK in your app, you'll reference the environment to get started.
