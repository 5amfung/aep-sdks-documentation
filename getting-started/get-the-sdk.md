1. Open the **Mobile** property in Launch, and on the **Environments** tab, read the instructions to add the SDKs to an app.
2. In the table, find the platform that you want and click the box icon under the **Install** column.
3. On the **Mobile Install Instructions** dialog box, select **Android** or **iOS**.
4. Follow the instructions for using Gradle with Android or CocoaPods with iOS.

The necessary dependencies and initialization code can be copied from the dialog box to your app project.
