# Next steps

Now that you have initialized the SDK and the Mobile Core extension, you can start implementing extensions that will help you use the Adobe Experience Platform SDKs or third-party vendor functionality in your apps.

To get started, select an extension:

* Set up [Adobe Analytics](../using-mobile-extensions/adobe-analytics/)
* Set up [Adobe Audience Manager](../using-mobile-extensions/adobe-audience-manager/)
* Set up [Adobe Target](../using-mobile-extensions/adobe-target/)
