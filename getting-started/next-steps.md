# Next Steps

Now that you've initialized the SDK and the **Mobile Core**, you can now start implementing **Extensions** that will help you use Adobe Experience Cloud or third-party vendor functionality in your apps.

Choose an extension to get started:

1. Setup [Adobe Analytics](../mobile-extensions/adobe-analytics/)
2. Setup [Adobe Audience Manager](../mobile-extensions/adobe-audience-manager/)
3. Setup [Adobe Target](../mobile-extensions/adobe-target/)
