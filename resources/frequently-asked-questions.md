# Frequently Asked Questions

### Launch

#### How to delete a mobile property in Launch?

You may delete a mobile property from Launch by following these [instructions](https://docs.adobelaunch.com/administration/companies-and-properties#delete-a-property). Please note that if you choose to delete a mobile property, it may not be undone.

### Migration

#### Can I run both 4x and the new Adobe Experience Platform SDKs on my app?

Implementing both SDKs is not recommended or supported. The Experience Platform SDK migrates 4x SDK's locally stored, user context. Using both SDKs can cause severe data quality issues and user cliffing.
