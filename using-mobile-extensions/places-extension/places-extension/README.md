# Places extension

With the Places extension, you can add your Places libraries to your mobile app to provide the POI context to the device's location. This extension also makes entry and exit events accessible in Launch rules, so your app can take action based on a user entering or exiting a POI.

The app can manage the device location with the operating system and notify the Places extension when a boundary is crossed in one of the following ways:

* Places Monitor extension in Adobe Launch.  This extension manages the device location with the operating system and passes the entry and/or exit notifications to the Places extension.
* Your app can use the OS apis to manage device location with the OS and then pass entry and/or exit notifications to the Places extension.
