# Places \(Beta\)

The Places extensions are the client-side technology, which is used to provide location awareness from your Places database to your mobile apps.   
  
Each extension provides the following functionality:

### **Places**

* Returns the point of interest \(POI\) membership and nearest POIs to the device so they can be used for region monitoring.
* Makes entry and exit events actionable from Launch rules.
* Automatically adds POI context to other Experience Cloud events that are already being tracked. Adobe Analytics integration available on \(3/20\).

### **Places Monitor** 

This extension manages device location by OS-specified region monitoring from the nearest POIs in your Places database and passing entry/exit events to the Places extension. This extension is optional and offers an alternative way to manage locations.
