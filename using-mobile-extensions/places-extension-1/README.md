# Places extensions \(Beta\)

The Places extensions are the client side technology needed to provide location awareness from your Places Database to your mobile apps. Each extension provides the following functionality:

* **The Places extension:**

  * Returns the POI membership and nearest POIs to the device so they can be used for region monitoring.
  * Makes entry and exit events actionable from Launch rules
  * Auto adds POI context to other Experience Cloud events that are already being tracked. Adobe Analytics integration available on \(3/15\)

* **The Places Monitor** **extension** manages device location by OS specified region monitoring from the nearest POIs in your Places database and passing entry/exit events to the Places extension. This extension is optional if you would like your manage location an alternate way.
