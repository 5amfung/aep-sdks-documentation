# Configuration

The Configuration extension is built into the Mobile Core. With its APIs, you generate the necessary events in the Event Hub that provide the configuration options for all installed extensions.

## Environment-aware configuration properties

This feature is only available in iOS ACPCore v2.0.3 or newer
{% endhint %}

Some extension developers might use different configuration values based on the working environment. In this case, the configuration generated might have several entries for the same property. For example, the Adobe Campaign Standard extension has different endpoints for development, staging, and production servers. Here is an example of a raw configuration that supports multiple build environments:

```javascript
{
  "myExtension.server": "mydomain.com",
  "__dev__myExtension.server": "mydomain.dev.com",
  "__stage__myExtension.server": "mydomain.stage.com"
}
```

{% hint style="success" %}
Each time a remote configuration is generated by Launch, a `build.environment` value is set based on the environment you are publishing. When the remote configuration is downloaded, the configuration extension considers the value in `build.environment` and provide __only the non-prefixed version for the current environment__ in the shared state. 
{% endhint %}

Below is a modification of the previous example, which now includes `build.environment`:

```javascript
{
  "build.environment": "dev",
  "myExtension.server": "mydomain.com",
  "__dev__myExtension.server": "mydomain.dev.com",
  "__stage__myExtension.server": "mydomain.stage.com"
}
```

The resulting Shared State from Configuration:

```javascript
{
  "build.environment": "dev",
  "myExtension.server": "mydomain.dev.com"  
}
```

### Sample configuration

Here's a sample JSON file for the SDK

```javascript
{
    "experienceCloud.org": "3CE342C75100435B0A490D4C@AdobeOrg",  
    "target.clientCode": "yourclientcode",  
    "target.timeout": 5,  
    "audience.server": "omniture.demdex.net",  
    "audience.timeout": 5,  
    "analytics.rsids": "mobilersidsample",  
    "analytics.server": "obumobile1.sc.omtrdc.net",  
    "analytics.aamForwardingEnabled": false,  
    "analytics.offlineEnabled": true,  
    "analytics.batchLimit": 0,  
    "analytics.backdatePreviousSessionInfo": false,
    "global.privacy": "optedin",  
    "lifecycle.sessionTimeout": 300,  
    "rules.url": "https://link.to.rules/test.zip"
}
```
