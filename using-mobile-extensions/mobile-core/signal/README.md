# Signal

The Signal extension is bundled with the [MobileCore (Android)/ACPCore (iOS)](https://aep-sdks.gitbook.io/docs/using-mobile-extensions/mobile-core/) extension and allows you to send postbacks to third party endpoints and open URLs (web URLs or application deep links) when using rules actions in Adobe Experience Platform Launch. 

By leveraging the same triggers and traits that you use to display an in-app message, you can configure the SDK to send customized data to a third-party destination. Also, with the appropriate permissions and configurations, you can use the `collectPii` API to send PII to a remote server.

To get started with Signal extension, complete the following steps::

1. Add **Signal** extension to your app.
2. Define the necessary rules in Adobe Launch. 
3. Implement the SDK APIs to send PII data to external destinations.

## Add Signal to your app

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Android" %}

Add the [Mobile Core](https://aep-sdks.gitbook.io/docs/using-mobile-extensions/mobile-core) extension to your project using the app's Gradle file.

```java
implementation 'com.adobe.marketing.mobile:sdk-core:1.+'
```

#### Java

Import the Signal extension in your application's main activity.

```java
import com.adobe.marketing.mobile.*;
```

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="iOS" %}
â€‹ Add the [Mobile Core](https://aep-sdks.gitbook.io/docs/using-mobile-extensions/mobile-core) extension to your project using Cocoapods.

Add following pods in your `Podfile`:

```shell
pod 'ACPCore'
```

Import the Signal libraries:

#### Objective-C

```objective-c
#import "ACPCore.h"
#import "ACPSignal.h"
```

#### Swift

```swift
import ACPCore
import ACPSignal
```

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="React Native" %}

#### JavaScript

Install Signal

```jsx
npm install @adobe/react-native-acpcore
react-native link @adobe/react-native-acpcore
```

Importing the Signal extension

```jsx
import {ACPSignal} from '@adobe/react-native-acpcore';
```

Note: if using Cocoapods, run:

```
pod install
```

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Register Signal extension

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Android" %}

#### Java

To call the set up methods that call the [setApplication\(\)](https://aep-sdks.gitbook.io/docs/using-mobile-extensions/mobile-core/mobile-core-api-reference#setapplication) method in the `onCreate()` method:

```java
public class MobileApp extends Application {

    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        super.onCreate();
        MobileCore.setApplication(this);
        MobileCore.configureWithAppId("yourAppId");
        try {
            Signal.registerExtension(); //Register Signal extension with Mobile Core
            MobileCore.start(null);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            //Log the exception
         }
    }
}
```

**Important**: Signal extension is automatically included in Core by Maven. When manually installing the Signal extension, ensure that you add the `signal-1.x.x.aar` library to your project.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="iOS" %}
In your app's`application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions`, register Signal with Mobile Core:

#### Objective-C

```objectivec
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
    [ACPCore configureWithAppId:@"yourAppId"];
    [ACPSignal registerExtension];
    [ACPCore start:nil];
    // Override point for customization after application launch.
    return YES;
 }
```

#### Swift

```swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
     ACPCore.configure(withAppId: "yourAppId")   
     ACPSignal.registerExtension()
     ACPCore.start(nil)
     // Override point for customization after application launch.
     return true;
}
```

**Important**: Signal extension is automatically included in the Core pod. When installing the Signal extension manually, ensure that you added the `libACPSignal_iOS.a` library to your project.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="React Native" %}

#### JavaScript

```jsx
import {ACPSignal} from '@adobe/react-native-acpcore';

initSDK() {
    ACPSignal.registerExtension();
}
```

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

##Define rules in Adobe Launch

Define the rules in Adobe Launch by following the steps in the [Signal extension and Rules engine Integaration document](signals-extension-and-rules-engine-integration)

##Implement the SDK APIs to send PII data to external destinations

To send PII data to external destinations, the `PII` action can trigger the Rules engine when certain triggers and traits match. When setting a rule, you can also set the `PII` action for a Signal event. The `collectPii` API can then be used to trigger the rule and send the PII data.

For the information on collectPii and its usage, see collectPii in [AEP Mobile Core API reference Page](https://aep-sdks.gitbook.io/docs/using-mobile-extensions/mobile-core/mobile-core-api-reference#collect-pii)
