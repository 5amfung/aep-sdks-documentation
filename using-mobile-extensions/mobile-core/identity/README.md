# Identity

The Identity framework enables your app with Adobe's Experience Cloud ID service. This service helps with the synchronization of Adobe and other customer identifiers. 

{% hint style="danger" %}
While on web or other platforms, there may be use cases where this framework may not be required, implementation of this SDK framework on mobile apps is required.
{% endhint %}

To get started with Identity, complete the following steps:

1. Add the **Identity** framework to your app \(the Identiy framework comes pre-bundled as part of Mobile Core\).
2. Implement SDK APIs to complete the following tasks:
   1. Update customer IDs
   2. Appends Adobe visitor data to a URL string
   3. Return customer IDs
   4. Retrieve Experience Cloud IDs
   5. Set advertising IDs
   6. Set the device notification for push notifications

## Add Identity to your App

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Android" %}
**Java**

1. Add the library to your project
2. Import the library:

   `import com.adobe.marketing.mobile.*;`
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="iOS" %}
**Objective-C**

1. Add the library to your project
2. Import the library:

   `#import <ACPIdentity_iOS/ACPIdentity_iOS.h>`
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## **Register the Extension**

Here is the code sample to register the Identity extension:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Android" %}
```java
public class MobiletApp extends Application {
@Override
public void onCreate() {
super.onCreate();
     MobileCore.setApplication(this);
     try {
         Identity.registerExtension();
     } catch (Exception e) {
         //Log the exception
     }
  }
}
```

Verify that the app configuration contains the experienceCloud org:

```text
"experienceCloud.org" : "YOUR-MCORG-ID"
```

Experience Cloud Organization IDs uniquely identify each client company in the Adobe Experience Cloud. Here an example value of `YOUR-MCORG-ID`:

`016D5C175213CCA80A490D05@AdobeOrg`
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="iOS" %}
**Objective-C**

Register Identity extension in your app's `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` function:

```text
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
  [ACPIdentity registerExtension];
â€‹
  // Override point for customization after application launch.
  return YES;
}

```

Verify that the app configuration contains the experienceCloud org:

```text
"experienceCloud.org" : "YOUR-MCORG-ID"
```

Experience Cloud organization IDs uniquely identify each client company in the Adobe Experience Cloud and are similar to the following value:

`016D5C175213CCA80A490D05@AdobeOrg`
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

**Important:** You must include `@AdobeOrg`.

After the configuration is complete, an Experience Cloud ID will be generated and, where applicable, be included on all Analytics and Audience Manager hits. Other IDs, such as custom and automatically-generated IDs, will continue to be sent with each hit.
