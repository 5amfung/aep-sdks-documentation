## Features

### Effortless Implementation

Get started in a hurry with a few lines of code. Project Griffon works alongside the [Adobe Experience Platform Mobile SDK](../../) to help you inspect and validate app events, logs, device information, and more.

### Seamless Connection

Built with cutting-edge technology, Project Griffon avoids the need for network proxies, [MiTM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack), and other network gymnastics. Connecting your app to the interface can be as simple as just scanning a QR code.

### Instant Validation

After you connect, easily inspect live-streamed app events and activity. Filter & search to eliminate noise. Events contain detail to validate, debug, and troubleshoot your mobile app implementation.
